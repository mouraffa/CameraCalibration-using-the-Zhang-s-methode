# Camera Calibration

This program implements a camera calibration algorithm based on Zhang's method. It allows you to calibrate your camera, estimate its intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, and correct for lens distortion effects. The calibration parameters obtained can be used for various computer vision tasks, such as 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and image rectification.

## Algorithm Overview

The camera calibration algorithm follows these main steps:

1. **Checkerboard Initialization:** Define the dimensions of the checkerboard pattern (number of internal corners) and create a grid of 3D object points corresponding to the corners of the checkerboard in a real-world coordinate system.

2. **Image Acquisition:** Collect a set of images of the checkerboard pattern from different viewpoints.

3. **Corner Detection:** Convert each image to grayscale and apply a corner detection algorithm (e.g., Harris corner detector) to find the corners of the checkerboard pattern in the grayscale image. The detected corners are represented as 2D image points.

4. **Corner Refinement:** Refine the detected corner coordinates using the `cv2.cornerSubPix` function to improve the accuracy of the corner coordinates.

5. **Calibration Parameter Estimation:** Store the refined 2D image points and the corresponding 3D object points. Use these point correspondences to estimate the camera calibration parameters. This estimation is performed using the `cv2.calibrateCamera` function, which employs a nonlinear optimization technique.

6. **Distortion Correction:** Use the calibration parameters, including the camera matrix and distortion coefficients, to correct the distortion in the input images using the `cv2.undistort` function.

7. **Results:** Obtain the calibration parameters, including the camera matrix, distortion coefficients, rotation vectors, and translation vectors. These parameters can be utilized for various computer vision tasks.
